## Problem

Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then return `0`.

**Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).**

### Examples:

| #   | Input      | Output | Explanation |
| --- | ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1   | `x = 123`  | `321`  | `---`       |
| 2   | `x = -123` | `-321` | `---`       |
| 3   | `x = 120`  | `21`   | `---`       |

### Constraints:

-   `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`
